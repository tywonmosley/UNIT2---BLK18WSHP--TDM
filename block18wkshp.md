# Unit Test - Workshop 18

## Prompts:

For each prompt below: 

- Read the prompt.
- Identify the expectations.
- Write specifications in pseudocode/plain English for all the tests that would be useful for that prompt.
   - Try to take any "edge cases," or unexpected circumstances, into account, and write test specs for them.
    - Try not to write extraneous tests!

## Overview

In this workshop, you are going to write instructions for tests, often known as test specifications, or test specs, for a series of prompts. 

## Unit Test:

1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

## Functional Test:
1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
